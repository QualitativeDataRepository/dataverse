Functionality has been added to help validate dataset JSON prior to dataset creation. There are two new API endpoints in this release. The first takes in a collection alias and returns a custom dataset schema based on the required fields of the collection. The second takes in a collection alias and a dataset JSON file and does an automated validation of the JSON file against the custom schema for the collection. In this release funtionality is limited to json format validation and validating required elements. Future releases will address field types, controlled vocabulary, etc. (Issue #9464 and #9465)
